### Documenting the the migration to Python

 ----------
**Progress so far**
1. Code Academy: [Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)
 - Python 2
 - A bit challenging from the prospective of a person who's never done much scripting or familiar with the python syntax
 - I enjoyed the pseudo battleship project

2. DataCamp: [Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)
 - Python 3
 - Substantially easier since being previously exposed to Python 2
 - Most issues revovled around using Python 2 syntax instead of Python 3

 ----------
**In Progress**
3. [Hacker Rank: 30 Days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code)

**On Hold**
4. [Learn Python The Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/)
